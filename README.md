# hackaton-project
project given by my highschool

My highschool gave us a "challenge". We had to do a flashcard application to revise history dates in any language (even scratch was allowed). I decided to do it with Python and do a gui with tkinter module. There is a user manual but it is in French. The application is in French too.

So if you want to use this application, execute "HistoryFlashcards.exe" or you can run "Main.py". A window will open. To the left, there is the card with the question, you can turn it to have his answer with the button below the card. After this, you can tell, how the question was difficult for you with buttons on the right. When you turn every cards, a next serie comes with same questions but there is more chance to get a question you didn't know that a question you said you know the answer. You do this until all questions are too easy for you.
